# Tailor and Measure
Code sample of a web app that builds a dynmic zip file on the server based on user selection.

Built as an extension of an existing WordPress site and designed to fit within an exiting theme.
Note: Couldn't use jQuery's $ alias in this environment.

This code let's the user make selections via a guided UI, dynamically builds a zip file on the server (AWS), then prompts the user to download their custom zip file.
